# Verification Notes

## ALU Functional Simulation

Status: passed.

Files tested:

- `rtl/alu.sv`
- `tb/alu_tb.sv`

Simulator:

- Vivado XSim

Tests covered:

- ADD
- SUB
- AND
- OR
- XOR
- Invalid/default opcodes

Result:

- ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR and invalid/default opcode tests passed.
- Console output included: "All ALU tests passed."
- The upgraded testbench currently reports: "All 27 ALU tests passed."
- A VCD waveform was generated and viewed.

Waveform notes:

- The generated waveform file is `alu_tb.vcd`.
- The ALU waveform image is saved as `docs/images/alu_waveform.png`.

Conclusion:

Initial ALU functional simulation passed.

## Register File Functional Simulation

Status: passed.

Files tested:

- `rtl/register_file.sv`
- `tb/register_file_tb.sv`

Simulator:

- Vivado XSim

Tests covered:

- Reset clears registers.
- Register `x0` is hardwired to zero.
- Writes to `x0` are ignored.
- Writes and reads across registers `x1` to `x31`.
- Both asynchronous read ports reading different registers.
- Both asynchronous read ports reading the same register.
- Disabled write preserves existing data.
- Overwrite of an existing register.
- Read-before-write and read-after-write clock behaviour.
- Second reset clears written register contents.

Result:

- Console output included: "All 55 register file checks passed."
- Simulation completed at 457 ns.
- A VCD waveform was generated.

Waveform notes:

- The generated waveform file is `register_file_tb.vcd`.
- The register file waveform image is saved as `docs/images/register_file_waveform.png`.

Conclusion:

Initial register file functional simulation passed.

## Future Verification Work

- Add verification entries for each new RTL module.
- Save useful waveform screenshots in `docs/images/`.
- Keep testbenches self-checking.
- Use `$fatal` or an equivalent failure mechanism when checks fail.
- Record simulator, files tested, coverage points and conclusions for each simulation.
